# Roles

| ROLE         | PERSON       | RESPONSIBILITIES                                |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------             |
| UI           | Blake        |                                                |
| SBC/SW       | Aidian       |                                                |
| FIRMWARE     | Patrick      |                                                |
| HARDWARE     | Jake         | design schematics, wiring diagrams & PCB files |

These are the general outlines for the four different roles in the project. We 
have a verbal agreement at the moment that we will help out with parts of the
project outside our roles as needed.

# Tooling

| Purpose            | Name                |
| ------------------ | -------------       |
| Version Control    | Git                 |
| Project Management   | GitHub Projects     |
| Documentation      | Rustdocs & MD       |
| Test framework     | Rust & Cmocka       |
| Editor             | ANY                 |
| Schematics & PCB   | KiCAD               |
| Communication       | Discord/Teams/Email |
|                    |                     |

## Version Control

Git will allow our team to track changes in the projects files over time. Also
prevents the loss of work from hardware failures.

## Project Management

GitHub projects is integrated into github organizations as well as git. The 
project management software makes the collaboration between developers easy and
will make tracking milestones and issues  for the entire project across
multiple repositories a possibility.

## Documentation

## Test Frameworks

## Schematics & PCB

The KiCAD program gives access to the schematics and PCB designs to all team 
members due to the software begin free and open-source.

It will allow us to comment, label and design the needed circuits for the
physical hardware of the system; providing a good troubleshooting resource as
well.

## Communication



# Definition of Done(DOD)

## TESTING

### Quality Assurance

### Feedback


# Release Cycle

For the moment we will used semantic versioning with the standard
Major.minor.patch format. This will help when it comes to dealing
with any major changes that break APIs.

## Contingency Plans


# Timeline



# Environments

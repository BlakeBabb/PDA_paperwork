# Product Requirements Document(PRD)

**Authors:** Jake Goodwin, Aidan Agee, Blake Babb, Patrick Iacob

**DATE:** 2023-11-23

## Problem Description

Existing personal data acquisition devices are either too expensive or too DIY for most potential users. Many are designed for aerospace, automotive or research purposes, and are too expensive and unnecessarily complicated for casual users. The only other option is for users to build their own devices from prefabricated parts, which is too complicated and requires too much much prerequisite knowledge for most potential users.

### Scope

### Use Cases

The user will take the product along with them on an outdoor activity and subject it to normal conditions for that activity.
The user will connect the product to a phone or laptop they brought with them, and view the data stream and take samples using the user interface, and save the data locally.

## Purpose and Vision(Background)

Our purpose is to develop a personal data acquisition system that records all the data a user might want, 
and is cheap and easy to set up and use. It should be able to record data on acceleration, force, position, etc.
require minimal setup, and can be hooked up to bike, go-kart, etc.

## Stakeholders

**Capstone Team**   
The capstone team are the main decision makers for the project, and will need extensive information for the product’s requirements and implementation details. They will also need oversight from the project partner and TA.  

**Project Partner**  
The project partner will be working very closely with the capstone team, and will need to know the teams capabilities and status, and the status of the project. 

**Project TA**    
The TA needs to be informed on project progress and any issues the team may be having.  

**Capstone Instructors**  
The instructors require much of the same information as the TA, but because they are working less closely with the team there is less urgency. 

**Users**  
Users will need to know the product’s capabilities, limitations and intended use.

## Preliminary Context

### Assumptions

### Constraints

* As undergraduate students, our team has limited experience in the field, so we will have to learn a lot to deliver the product.
* Our budget is limited, so we will have to choose components carefully based on price.
* We are limited to three terms to deliver our product.


### Dependencies

## Market Assessment and Competition Analysis

DEWEsoft sells test and measurement equipment. Their products are not a good fit for our users because they are designed for industry, and therefore overkill and are prohibitively expensive for an individual.

Omega Engineering sells data loggers that can record the data our users would want, can connect to a remote device over Bluetooth and have easy to use interfaces. However most of their data loggers only record one or two types of data, so a user would need to buy many of them, which would be inconvenient and expensive.

An Apple Watch can track a user’s activity data, and send it to an iPhone with an easy to read interface. However, the Apple Watch is limited in what kind of data it can record, and would not be appropriate for our users due to its many other unneeded functions.

There are guides on the internet that instruct a user on how to build their own data acquisition device using Arduino or Raspberry Pi microcontrollers much more inexpensively than the other alternatives. However, this requires the user to have background knowledge in circuitry and programming, and requires a lot of time and effort to set up.

## Target Demographics(user persona)

## Requirements


### user stories and features (functional requirements)

### non-functional requirements

* Delay on data transmission should be at an acceptable level
* Code should be well documented, following coding standards and best practices
* User interface should intuitive and fast to use
* The product should use security best practices whenever possible

### data requirements

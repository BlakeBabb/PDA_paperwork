\section{Abstract}
\paragraph{
The aim of this senior capstone project is to design and implement a versatile
data logging system that integrates single board computers (SBCs), STM32
microcontrollers, and the Rust programming language. The system will be capable
of collecting, storing, and processing data from various sensors and input
sources, providing a flexible and reliable solution for a wide range of
applications.
}

\paragraph{
The project will involve the development of software for both the SBCs and
STM32 microcontrollers, leveraging the unique capabilities of each platform.
The Rust programming language will be used for its safety, performance, and
ease of use, allowing for efficient and reliable code development.
}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selection and integration of sensors and input devices for data 
        collection.
    \item Design and implementation of communication protocols between SBCs 
        and STM32 microcontrollers. 
    \item Development of data processing algorithms and storage mechanisms.
    \item Creation of a user interface for system configuration and data 
        visualization.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{
The project will culminate in the deployment and testing of the data logging
system in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and
reliability. The system will be designed with scalability and modularity in
mind, allowing for future expansion and customization.
}

\paragraph{
Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for data logging
applications, showcasing the capabilities of modern embedded systems and the
Rust programming language in real-world applications.
